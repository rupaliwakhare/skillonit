// 11. Can a variable name start with a number?

//  No, a variable name cannot start with a number in JavaScript. If you try to do so, the interpreter will throw an error because JavaScript follows specific rules for naming variables.

// A variable name must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).

// It can contain letters, numbers, and underscoresâ€”but never start with a number.

// // It must not be a reserved keyword like var, let, or function.
