8. What is HTML
   HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design
   documents on the World Wide Web. It provides the structure and content of web pages by using 
   a system of tags and attributes.

   Here's a short breakdown of HTML:

   Hypertext: HTML allows for the creation of hypertext documents, which are documents containing hyperlinks
              that connect to other documents or resources on the web.

   Markup Language: HTML uses markup tags to define elements within a document, such as headings, paragraphs,
                 lists, links, images, and more. These tags indicate how the content should be structured and
                 displayed in a web browser.

   Structure: HTML provides the basic structure for web pages, including elements for headings, paragraphs, 
              lists, tables, forms, and more. It allows you to organize and present content in a logical and 
              hierarchical manner.

   Semantics: HTML also incorporates semantic elements that describe the meaning of the content, making it more
              accessible to both humans and search engines. Semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>,
              <footer>, <article>, <section>, and <aside> provide additional context to the content of a web page.

  Overall, HTML serves as the foundation for web development, providing the structure and content of web pages 
  that are then styled and enhanced using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and made interactive using JavaScript.



9.  History of HTML
    HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.
    Before he created HTML, he used to send research documents via email.
    To make it easier for scientists at different universities to gain access to each other's
    documents, he created HTML.


10. Why has HTML become so popular and why not MS docs
    User-friendly
    Very lightweight
    Easy to learn
    Easy to integrate with all browsers

11. So is HTML a programming language or not?

12. What are HTML tags?
    We use HTML tags for placing the elements in the proper and appropriate format. 
    Tags use the symbols <, and > to set them apart from the HTML content.

     The HTML tags need not be closed always. For example, in the case of images, the closing tags
     are not required as <img> tag.

13. What is an element in HTML?
    An element in HTML is a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page.
    It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

14. What are HTML Attributes?
    Attributes are the properties that can be added to an HTML tag. These attributes change the way
    the tag behaves or is displayed. For example, a <img> tag has an src attribute, which you use to
    add the source from which the image should be displayed.

    We add attributes right after the name of the HTML tag, inside the brackets. We can only add the
    attributes to opening or self-closing tags, but never be in closing tags.


15. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
    No, HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page, while HTML elements
    are made up of a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page.

16. What are HTML Entities?
    HTML Entities are special characters used to represent characters that cannot be typed on a keyboard. 
    They are often used to display special symbols and foreign characters. 

    HTML entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). Here are some commonly used HTML entities:

    &amp; - Represents the ampersand character (&).
    &lt; - Represents the less-than symbol (<).
    &gt; - Represents the greater-than symbol (>).
    &quot; - Represents the double quotation mark (").
    &apos; - Represents the single quotation mark or apostrophe ('). Note: This entity is not
              supported in HTML 4.01, but is supported in HTML5.
    &nbsp; - Represents a non-breaking space.
    &copy; - Represents the copyright symbol (©).
    &reg; - Represents the registered trademark symbol (®).
    &trade; - Represents the trademark symbol (™).
    &euro; - Represents the Euro currency symbol (€).
