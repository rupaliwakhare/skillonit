constructer

In JavaScript, a constructor is a special method used to create and initialize objects when a class is instantiated. It is defined using the constructor keyword inside a class.



Key Points:
The constructor method is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created using the new keyword.
It is used to initialize object properties.
