*Asynchronous*
 
Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to perform tasks without blocking the main thread, enabling smoother and more efficient execution, especially for tasks like fetching data from APIs, reading files, or handling timers. 



settimeout
The setTimeout function is a built-in way to execute code after a specified delay,

setInterval
The function you're thinking of is setInterval, and it’s like the cousin of setTimeout—but instead of running once after a delay, it keeps going at regular intervals ⏱️.

clearInterval
To stop a setInterval from repeating, you use the clearInterval() function—and you need to pass it the interval ID returned by setInterval.


syntax

function rua(){
    console.log("Hello World")
}

settimeout(rua,2000)



setInterval

it is used to repeating a function
