üß† DOM in JavaScript stands for the Document Object Model‚Äîa programming interface that lets JavaScript interact with and manipulate HTML and XML documents.

üå≥ What is the DOM?
Think of your webpage as a tree of objects.

Each HTML element (like <p>, <div>, <img>) becomes a node in this tree.

JavaScript can access, modify, add, or remove these nodes dynamically.

üõ†Ô∏è What Can You Do with the DOM?
Access elements: document.getElementById("myId")

Change content: element.innerHTML = "Hello!"

Modify styles: element.style.color = "red"

React to events: element.addEventListener("click", myFunction)

Create or delete elements: document.createElement("div"), element.remove()

‚ú® Why It Matters
Enables dynamic content without reloading the page.

Powers interactive features like dropdowns, modals, and form validation.

Ensures cross-browser compatibility through a standardized API.
