ðŸ“œ What is DOM Level 1?
DOM Level 1 was the first official specification of the Document Object Model, released by the W3C in 1998. It laid the foundation for how JavaScript interacts with HTML and XML documents.

ðŸ§± Key Features of DOM Level 1
Core DOM: A generic interface for any structured document (like XML).

HTML DOM: Specialized for HTML documents, allowing access to elements like <body>, <form>, etc.

Introduced methods like:

getElementById()

getElementsByTagName()

createElement()

appendChild()

ðŸ§ª Example
html
<p id="demo">Hello!</p>
<script>
  let para = document.getElementById("demo");
  para.textContent = "Updated via DOM Level 1!";
</script>
ðŸ§  Why It Matters
DOM Level 1 was the starting point for modern web interactivity. While newer levels (like DOM Level 2 and 3) added events, styles, and traversal, DOM1 is still the core of how we manipulate the web today.
